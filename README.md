# Formageddon

This is a fork of [PPF's](https://github.com/opencongress/) form-solver gem. It's a work in progress, but has a couple of goals:

- Use CSS selectors to handle forms, rather than indexing a numbered form on a page
- Become at least semi-compatible with unitedstates/contact-congress
- Eventually move away from Mechanize and submit forms via a js-capable headless browser such as capybara/poltergeist.

## Installation

Is probably not a good idea just yet.
